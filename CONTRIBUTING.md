# Contributing to ZAP

Hello, and thank you for your interest in contributing to ZAP!  
Please take a minute to review our Contribution Guidelines, as this will help get your issue resolved or pull request merged faster.  
Contributions are always welcome, no matter how large or small. :)

## Reporting Issues

Before reporting an issue around graphics artifacts like missing menu buttons, strange colors, Moon not rendered, or similar, *please make absolutely sure* you are running the latest graphics drivers for your graphics card. Most graphics problems are solved this way.

Before reporting an issue, please check the recent open and closed issues to see whether it has been reported and solved/closed already. Don't report a new issue in this case; you may join the discussion.

If you want to report a bug, please make sure to update and verify the bug still exists in the current version.

Also look into the User Guide before reporting unexpected but correct behaviour.

If you miss translations, please help us with your language and join our translators.

If the bug still persists, or you find any typos, errors, or have new feature suggestions, feel free to open a new issue.

When opening an issue to report a problem, please try and provide minimal steps that reproduce the issue, and also include details of the operating system, ZAP version, and Graphics Card info you are using.

## Pull Requests (Contributing code)

So you're interested in contributing code to ZAP? Excellent!

Most contributions to ZAP are done via pull requests from GitHub users' forks of the ZAP repository.  
If you're new to this style of development, please read over our development workflow.

You may also/instead be interested in contributing to ZAP affiliated content, like landscapes, sky cultures, DSO or planetary textures, and scripts.

Once you open a pull request (which should be opened against the `master` branch), please make sure that you include the following:

- **Code**: the code you are adding, which should follow as much as possible our coding guidelines.
- **Tests**: these are usually tests to ensure that code that previously failed now works (regression tests) or tests that cover as much as possible of the new functionality to make sure it doesn't break in future, and also returns consistent results on all platforms.
- **Documentation**: if you are adding new functionality, be sure to include a description in the main documentation or doxygen description/comments for code in the `*.hpp` files.

Thanks!

\- *The ZAP development team*
